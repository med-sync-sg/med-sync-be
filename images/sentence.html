, a bit of tummy pain uh mainly on the left-hand side, um and vomiting and fever and you're quite weak and lethargic um, you mentioned you had this Chinese takeaway as little as three days ago and I wondered whether that might be the cause of your problems.<br>Patient: Yeah.<br>Patient: <br>Patient: Okay.<br>Doctor: Um, it seems like you may have something, uh, called gastroenteritis, which essentially just a tummy bug or infection of your uh of your tummy.<br>Patient: <br>Doctor: Uh, mainly caused by viruses but there can be a possibility of bacteria uh causing its symptoms. Um.<br>Patient: Yeah.<br>Patient: Yeah.<br>Doctor: At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids.<br>Patient: <br>Patient: Mm-hmm.<br>Doctor: Um, there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins.<br>Patient: Okay.<br>Doctor: Um, and if you are having vomiting

 I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.<br>Patient: Yep.<br>Doctor: If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help.<br>Patient: Yep.<br>Doctor: I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest.<br>Patient: Okay.<br>Patient: Yeah.<br>Doctor: Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again.<br>Patient: Okay, sure.<br>Doctor: Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms.<br>Patient: Yep.<br>Doctor: Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that.<br>Patient: <br>Doctor: Um, etcetera etcetera.<br>Patient: Yep, sure, yep.<br>Doctor: How's that sound?<br>Patient: That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.<br>Doctor: Do you have any questions for me?<br>Patient: Um, no, no further questions, no.<br>Doctor: Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear?<br>Patient: Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.<br>Doctor: Great. Well, I wish you all the best.<br>Patient: Okay, thank you. Bye.<br>Doctor: Thank you. Bye bye.</div>
